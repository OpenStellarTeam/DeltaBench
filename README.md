## 💥 DeltaBench

**DeltaBench** is the first dataset to analyze the qualities of the long CoTs generated by o1-like models and evaluate the critique abilities to **D**etect **E**rror in Long Co**T** Re**A**soning of existing critic models and PRMs. Specifically, DeltaBench comprises 1,236 samples across diverse domains, including **Math**, **Programming**, **PCB** (physics, chemistry and biology), and **General Reasoning**. Each sample encompasses a problem, its corresponding long CoT solution, and comprehensive human annotations

## 🆕 News

- **[Soon]** We plan to release more of our labeled datasets, which will be available for training and research purposes. **Stay tuned** 🔥🔥🔥

- **\[2025.03.05\]** We have released the DeltaBench dataset 🤗[huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenStellarTeam/DeltaBench) 🚀🚀🚀.

  

## 💫 Introduction

* We introduce DeltaBench, the first dataset to analyze the qualities of the long CoTs generated by o1-like models and evaluate the critique abilities to **D**etect **E**rror in Long Co**T** Re**A**soning of existing critic models and PRMs. Specifically, in DeltaBench, we first collect a diverse collection of long CoTs generated by various o1-like models (i.e., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini-2.0 Flash Thinking) across different reasoning tasks such as **Math**, **Programming**, **PCB** (physics, chemistry and biology), and **General Reasoning**.
  Then, we divide each long COT into different sections, where each section denotes an independent subtask, as shown in Figure 1.

</p>
​	After that, each section includes the following tags:

* 1️⃣**Strategy Shift:** whether this section introduces a new method or strategy attempt. If a new strategy is introduced, the specific step is annotated.
* 2️⃣**Reasoning Usefulness:** whether the reasoning in this section is useful. 
* 3️⃣**Reasoning Correctness:** whether this section contains any errors. If an error is present, additional error-related fields are annotated, including the first step number at which the error occurs, explanation and correction.
* 4️⃣**Reflection Efficiency:** whether this section contains reflection and whether the reflection is correct. If reflection is present, the step at which the reflection begins is annotated.

## ⚖️ Evals

The startup command is as follows: 

- Step 1: set your openai key in scripts/chinese_simpleqa_easy.py:

  ```
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "replace your key here"
  os.environ["OPENAI_BASE_URL"] = "replace your key here"
  ```

- Step 2: run the eval script:

  ```
  python evaluation.py <model_name>
  ```

- Step 3: we also provide a unified processing script for multiple model results. After running it, you can get a complete leaderboard:

  ```
  python get_leaderboard.py
  ```
